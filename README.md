`Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend `Fashion-MNIST` to serve as a direct **drop-in replacement** for the original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Here's an example how the data looks (*each class takes three-rows*):

## Why we made Fashion-MNIST

The original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. *"If it doesn't work on MNIST, it **won't work** at all"*, they said. *"Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."* 

### To Serious Machine Learning Researchers

Seriously, we are talking about replacing MNIST. Here are some good reasons:
